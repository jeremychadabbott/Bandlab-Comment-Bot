# Bandlab-Comment-Bot
THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DIRECTLY VIOLATES BANDLAB TOS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This bot is very simple, and is unable to verify it's email. It is made simply to comment on the top post of the explore stream, after creating a new account.
To make the bot post whatever you want, you need to replace the comment "This is a great post!" with your comment. Make sure not to edit any of the other code or IT WILL BREAK!!! Btw, the code is programmed to repeat 20 times. However, you can choose the amount you want. You will need to have Selenium ready and prepped on your computer as well.

IF YOU ENJOYED THIS CODE, PLEASE REMEMBER TO STAR THE REPOSITORY!!! THANKS!
